# Assignment 2 â€“ Treasure Chests

## Value (%)
This assignment is worth 10% of your course grade.

## Task

Complete the implementation of the `TreasureChest` class, which represents a treasure chest with different states and properties. The class has a state machine representing the transitions between its states (open, closed/unlocked, and locked). You will need to implement the required methods to manipulate the chest's state based on the provided actions, such as opening, closing, locking, and unlocking.

## Key Components

- Implement the default and parameterized constructors.
- Implement the `Manipulate` method, which takes an `Action` and updates the state of the chest based on the state diagram.
- Implement the private `Unlock`, `Lock`, `Open`, and `Close` methods to update the chest's state accordingly.

## Testing

Ensure that your implementation works as expected by testing different actions and state transitions on a `TreasureChest` object.

## How to Complete This Assessment
1. Implement the default constructor:
   - Assign default values to `_material`, `_lockType`, and `_lootQuality`.

2. Implement the parameterized constructor:
   - Assign the values of `material`, `lockType`, and `lootQuality` to their corresponding private fields.

3. Implement the `Manipulate` method:
   - Implement a switch statement based on the provided `action` parameter.
   - For each action, check the current `_state` of the chest.
     - If the action is valid for the current state, call the corresponding private method (e.g., `Open`, `Close`, `Lock`, `Unlock`) and update the `_state` accordingly.
     - If the action is not valid, return null or throw an exception.
   - Return the updated state after performing the action.
   - Add documentation for this method.

4. Implement the `Unlock`, `Lock`, `Open`, and `Close` methods:
   - For each method, update the `_state` according to the state diagram.
   - Add documentation for each method.

5. There's no need to modify the `ToString` and `ConsoleHelper` methods as they are already implemented.

6. Ensure that the implemented methods are working as expected by testing different actions and state transitions on a `TreasureChest` object. You should write unit tests for the other methods as well.

## Note on the Main Method

It is not necessary to use the `Main` method for this assignment, as the focus is on the `TreasureChest` class implementation. However, feel free to use the `Main` method for additional testing of your implementation to ensure it is working as expected.
